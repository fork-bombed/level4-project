## Observations
- Seems to be a lot of repetition in code, or some chunks that aren't being used
- Unsure why tuples and dictionaries are being used at intermediate steps rather than objects

## Progress
- Understanding the code
- Extended the code to allow multiple parsers
- Built skeleton code for QUIC parser

## Goals
- Understand flow of the program
- Document areas that need refactoring
