## Overview
- Packet Payload a PDU?
  - (it is not)

## Problems
- Unsure how to call the function to parse a variable length integer when used as a field size
- Still unsure how to handle optional/repeating fields, multiple arbitrary sizes, and range sizes

## Goals
- Handle size constraints for arbitrary length and variable-length integers
- Expand QUIC spec to define PDUs
- Think about generalised cases rather than quic specific
- Make changes in QUIC spec that seem necessary
- Create example of variable length integers enum
