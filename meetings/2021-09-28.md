- 30 min meetings every week
- Send any drafts along early

## Comments
- Think about testing the code and making more robust
- Take notes if changing QUIC spec to work with the codebase

## Coding Conventions

- Keep consistent with other code

## Goals
- Requirements analysis (project is open-ended as QUIC has many extensions)
- Write a more concrete plan after understanding code better
- Create a repository for level 4 dissertation, timelog and other docs
- Fork the NPT tool repository and link to it from the level 4 project repo
- Understand the internal representation of code
