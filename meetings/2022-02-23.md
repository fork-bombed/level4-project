## Overview
- Rough outline and wrote some sections for the dissertation
- Collecting papers on other parsers (although haven't looked at them in detail yet)

- Var length encoding MPEG video or DNS
- Can QUIC be represented by parsing the packet description language? No :)


## Problems
- Not too sure how to evaluate the paper
- Not sure what to put in analysis/requirements

## Goals
- QUIC unique, discuss
- Mention other parsers and trade-offs
