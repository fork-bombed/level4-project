# Problems

Too many subsection, cut down on headers to improve readability

# Introduction

Too much in intro, move code generation into analysis/requirements. References to complex sections too detailed.

# Background

Too much detail in IETF and Jon Postel background. Brief background but not too much detail on the history.

RFCs not black & white monospace, they are ASCII

Mention TLS presentation language -> Martin Tomson copied some stuff from TLS. 
Also evidence of people doing things in this space


# Parsing

Compare to compiler, data is not *not* correct, but will be type checked and sanity checked after parsed
