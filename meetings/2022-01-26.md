## Overview
- QUIC RFC altered to include:
  - Enum definitions
  - Sizes explicitly state "variable-length integer" rather than "i"
- Possible to declare an enum with the same name as a structure to show that it's a PDU
  - This might cause problems with internal representation
  - Possibly similar naming convention?

## Problems
- Unsure how to call the function to parse a variable length integer when used as a field size
- Still unsure how to handle optional/repeating fields, multiple arbitrary sizes, and range sizes

## Goals
- Handle size constraints for arbitrary length and variable-length integers
- Expand QUIC spec to define PDUs
- Think about generalised cases rather than quic specific
- Make changes in QUIC spec that seem necessary
- Create example of variable length integers enum
