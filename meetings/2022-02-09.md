## Overview
- PDUs can now be inferred
- Example document created for testing

## Problems
- Can't put number constraints on variable length integers -> is this even needed?
  - Why would an enum field type need constraints? Surely field sizes and values are inferred
- Still unsure how to handle optional/repeating fields, multiple arbitrary sizes, and range sizes

## Goals
- Handle size constraints for arbitrary length and variable-length integers
- Think about generalised cases rather than quic specific
- Try variable-length integer struct instead of enum
