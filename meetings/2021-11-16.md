## Overview
- Started writing status report and including requirements document into the report
- Added dissertation template to the project repo
- Updated GNU make
- Started working on converting parsed representation into internal representation

## Problems
- RFC string documents should be parsed before being sent to individual parsers
  - Reduce the amount of cases individual parsers have to deal with
  - Format of document shouldn't matter, should be passed to parser as the same object

## Goals
- Work on converting parsed representation into internal representation
  - Work on field size constraints
  - Figure out way to build structures recursively when referenced
