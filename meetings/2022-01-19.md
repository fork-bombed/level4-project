## Overview
- Parser now handles value constraints correctly
- Arbitrary sizes automatically inferred from length fields
- Variable length integers can now be parsed

## Problems
- Unsure how to call the function to parse a variable length integer when used as a field size
- Need to define everything as a PDU for the code to be generated
- Still unsure how to handle optional/repeating fields, multiple arbitrary sizes, and range sizes
- 

## Goals
- Handle size constraints for arbitrary length and variable-length integers
-
