## Overview
- Built basic diagram explaining the purpose of the parsed representation
- Parsed representation can now represent all packet types in QUIC RFC
- Parsed representation iterates over all structures and creates links to fields that reference other structures

## Problems
- Tests no longer run due to Makefile error, pulled latest master branch from repo
- GNU make update 4.3+

## Goals
- Work on converting parsed representation into internal representation
- Add requirements document to project template
