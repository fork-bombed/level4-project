## Overview
- Using a struct to represent a variable length integer would not work because there's no way to perform calculations on data like the augmented ascii diagrams

## Problems
- Optional fields seem impossible to infer when they will be present with the current syntax in QUIC RFC
- Still need to represent range sizes, possibly using same method as bits_consumed?
- Encountering too many problems with the code and not enough time to write dissertation
  - Priorities need to switch to writing the diss even though code is not finished

## Goals
- QUIC unique, discuss
- Mention other parsers and trade-offs
- Research style paper
