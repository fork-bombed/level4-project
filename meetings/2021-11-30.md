## Overview
- Clearly defined boundaries for parsed representation
- Added boundaries to comments

## Problems
- Tables/enums don't follow a consistent standard
- Possible to use Arrays for optional and repeating fields?

## Solutions
- Change tables/enums to be more parsable 
  - Keep human readable

## Goals
- Add Enum parsing to the parsed representation
- Work on converting parsed representation into internal representation
  - Work on field size constraints
- Modify the QUIC RFC to contain an Enum for variable-length integers
- Add parsed representation boundaries as a comment in the document
