## Overview
- Clearly defined boundaries for parsed representation

## Problems
- Can't wrap my head around enums and variable length integers

## Solutions
- Treat variable length integers as an enum
  - The first 2 bits are used as a key
  - The rest of the bits are used as a value that represents the size of the field
  - Use this to determine the size of the field

## Goals
- Add Enum parsing to the parsed representation
- Work on converting parsed representation into internal representation
  - Work on field size constraints
- Modify the QUIC RFC to contain an Enum for variable-length integers
- Add parsed representation boundaries as a comment in the document
