## Refactoring Ideas
- Build custom ParserException base class in parser.py. Allows for more accurate error handling in future.
- Generate internal representation types straight from the grammar file
- Increase modularity and readability by returning values from functions and then updating attributes rather than overwriting attributes within functions

## Questions
- Parsing straight to objects seems to simplify the code a lot, but I might encounter issues when types haven't been parsed/initialised yet?
- I don't really understand how I can created fields with fixed sizes, arbitrary sizes, etc

## Progress
- Basic parsing of basic fields work and produce a structure object
- Can now parse QUIC RFC documents correctly
- Identified some key areas for refactoring, going to do some trial and error with my QUIC implementation to see if it works any better

## Goals
- Implement parsing for more complicated field types
- Write up requirements document
